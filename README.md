Automated systematic literature review following the [PRISMA 2020](https://www.prisma-statement.org/prisma-2020) guidelines ([checklist](https://www.prisma-statement.org/prisma-2020-checklist) | [flow diagram](https://www.prisma-statement.org/prisma-2020-flow-diagram) | [Page et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.n71)). Search academic databases, deduplicate results, screen papers with keyword rules, and use AI-assisted screening via any MCP-compatible agent — all from the command line.

## Features

- **Multi-database search**: arXiv, Crossref, OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar (free, no API keys needed). Optional: Scopus.
- **Automatic deduplication**: DOI matching + fuzzy title matching
- **Two-pass screening**:
  - **Pass 1**: Rule-based keyword screening (automated, re-screenable with adjustable threshold)
  - **Pass 2**: AI-assisted eligibility screening via MCP (stricter criteria)
- **AI screening via MCP**: Works with Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Amazon Q, Gemini CLI, and any MCP-compatible agent
- **PRISMA 2020 flow diagram**: Interactive diagram matching the official template (Page et al., 2021) with download-as-PNG
- **Flexible export**: CSV with Elsevier-style field picker + BibTeX — exports only filtered papers, choose which columns to include
- **PDF download & viewer**: Download papers via Elsevier (institutional), arXiv, Unpaywall, Semantic Scholar — view inline in web app
- **Background pipeline**: Run search → dedup → screen in background with live progress, cancellation, and rate limit handling
- **Multi-project management**: Save, switch, duplicate, export/import projects — each with isolated config + data
- **Web dashboard**: Real-time pipeline stepper, stat cards, PRISMA flow diagram, PDF browser, eligibility filters

## Quick Start

### One-Command Launch (Web App)

```bash
cd prisma_tool
python start.py
```

That's it. On first run it will:
1. Create a Python virtual environment and install all dependencies
2. Install Node.js packages for the web frontend
3. Create `config.yaml` from the template (if missing)
4. Start the API server and web app on available ports
5. Open the dashboard in your browser

Press **Ctrl+C** to stop — it kills both the backend and frontend automatically.

```bash
# Options
python start.py --install     # Force reinstall all dependencies
python start.py --port 9000   # Custom backend port (frontend = port + 1000)
python start.py --no-browser  # Don't auto-open browser
python start.py --cli         # CLI mode only (no web app)
```

> **Requirements:** Python 3.10+ and Node.js 18+ must be installed.

### Configure

Edit `config.yaml` with your search queries, date range, and screening keywords — or use the **Settings** page in the web app. See [docs/CONFIG_GUIDE.md](docs/CONFIG_GUIDE.md) for details.

### CLI Usage (Without Web App)

If you prefer the command line:

```bash
python start.py --cli     # Sets up venv, shows CLI commands

# Then activate and run:
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# Full pipeline
python -m prisma_review run-all

# Or step by step
python -m prisma_review search        # Search databases
python -m prisma_review dedup         # Remove duplicates
python -m prisma_review screen-rules  # Keyword screening
python -m prisma_review report        # Generate PRISMA diagram
python -m prisma_review export        # Export .bib + .csv

# Check progress
python -m prisma_review status
```

### (Optional) AI Screening with Any MCP-Compatible Agent

Set up the MCP server to let AI agents (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) screen your papers. See [docs/MCP_SETUP.md](docs/MCP_SETUP.md).

### Web App Features

The web dashboard provides:
- **Dashboard** — Real-time pipeline stepper, stat cards, interactive PRISMA 2020 flow diagram
- **Screening** — Review papers with include/exclude/maybe decisions, re-screen with adjustable keyword threshold
- **Eligibility** — Second-pass AI-assisted screening for stricter criteria
- **All Papers** — Paginated, filterable, searchable table with field-picker export (CSV, BibTeX) — exports only filtered papers
- **Downloads** — PDF viewer for downloaded papers (Elsevier, arXiv, Unpaywall)
- **Settings** — Edit config, search queries, keywords, API keys from the browser
- **Projects** — Create, switch, duplicate, import/export literature review projects
- **MCP Settings** — View connection instructions for AI agents

## Two-Pass Screening Workflow

Broad search queries in emerging fields often return hundreds of papers. A single keyword screening pass is too coarse — you need a second, stricter pass.

```
Pass 1 (Keyword Rules)          Pass 2 (AI Eligibility)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━          ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1,600 records found             570 first-pass included
  → 57 duplicates removed         → AI reads each abstract
  → 973 excluded by rules         → Applies strict criteria
  → 570 included                  → ~50-80 final papers
```

**Pass 1** uses configurable keyword rules to quickly eliminate obviously irrelevant papers. Papers matching ≥N include keywords (and no exclude keywords) are included; the rest are excluded or flagged as "maybe" for AI review.

**Pass 2** uses Claude (via MCP) to read each first-pass included paper's abstract and apply domain-specific eligibility criteria, narrowing to only the most relevant studies for full-text review.

## Multi-Project Support

Each literature review is stored as an isolated project with its own config and data:

```
projects/
├── gfm-agriculture/
│   ├── config.yaml
│   └── prisma_output/
├── dl-medical/
│   ├── config.yaml
│   └── prisma_output/
└── .active_project              # tracks which project is loaded
```

- **Switch projects** without losing data — each project has its own pipeline state
- **Auto-migration**: Existing `config.yaml` + `prisma_output/` are automatically copied into `projects/` on first run (originals preserved for CLI)
- **Export/Import**: Share projects as `.zip` files
- **Duplicate**: Clone a project to start a new review from the same config

Manage projects via the web UI (`/projects`) or REST API (`/api/projects`).
